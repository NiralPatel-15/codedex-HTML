    <h1>New Hope in Gene Therapy: Trial Begins for Rare Disorder</h1>
    <h4>March 12, 2025</h4>
    <p>
        In a groundbreaking medical step, scientists have begun testing a new form of gene therapy
        aimed at treating a rare genetic disorder that has long defied conventional treatments.

        During the initial procedure, a 35-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman were treated with
        over 150 million modified immune cells. These cells carried a specially designed gene meant
        to repair faulty DNA responsible for the disease's progression.
